# car-servicing
A mobile app for the weekly recording of car checks.
## Motivation
This is a replacement for my current practice of recording my weekly car checks in Google Keep and Sheets.  I will only need to enter the data once, and then I'll have a record of my checks, servicing tasks and miles travelled.
## Current Version
v0.1.0
## Dependencies
- Firebase
## Changelog
- v0.1.0 - Initial Release
## Planned Features
### Data Readouts
- [ ] Miles Travelled between checks
